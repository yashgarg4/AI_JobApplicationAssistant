## ü§ñ How It Works

This project uses **CrewAI** to orchestrate a team of specialized AI agents, each with a specific role in the application process:

1.  **Resume Analyzer**: Extracts and structures information from your resume.
2.  **Job Description Deconstructor**: Breaks down the job posting into its core components.
3.  **Initial Match Analyzer**: Provides a quick pre-analysis of the resume-JD fit.
4.  **Strategic Resume Tailoring Advisor**: Compares the resume and job data to provide actionable improvement advice.
5.  **Expert Resume Editor**: Rewrites the resume based on the advisor's suggestions.
6.  **Persuasive Cover Letter Drafter**: Writes a compelling cover letter using all the analyzed context.
7.  **Resume Section Refinement Specialist**: Makes targeted edits to resume sections based on user feedback.

These agents work sequentially, passing information to one another to build a comprehensive and tailored application package.
